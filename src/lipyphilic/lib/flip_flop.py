"""Flip-flop --- :mod:`lipyphilic.lib.flip_flop`
================================================

:Author: Paul Smith
:Year: 2021

This module provides methods for finding flip-flop events in a lipid bilayer.

A flip-flop event occurs when a molecule - typically a sterol - moves from
one leaflet of a bilayer into the opposing leaflet.

The class :class:`lipyphilic.lib.flip_flop.FlipFlop` finds the frames at which
a flip-flop event begins and ends, as well as the direction of travel (upper-to-lower
or lower-to-upper). :class:`FlipFlop` can also determine whether each event was
successful (the molecule resides in the opposing leaflet for at least a given
length of time), or not (the molecule went to the midplane but returned to its
original leaflet).

See `Baral et al. (2020) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009308420300980>`_
for further discussion on flip-flop in lipid bilayers, including the affect on the flip-flop
rate of the buffer size used to assign molecules to the midplane of the bilayer.

Input
-----

Required:
  - *universe* : an MDAnalysis Universe object.
  - *lipid_sel* : atom selection for atoms to use in detecting flip-flop
  - *leaflets* : leaflet membership (-1: lower leaflet, 0: midplane, 1: upper leaflet) of each lipid in the membrane at each frame
  

Output
------

  - *resindex* : residue index of a flip-flopping molecule
  - *flip_flop_start_frame* : final frame at which the molecule was present in its original leaflet
  - *flip_flop_end_frame* : first frame at which the molecule is present in the new leaflet
  - *moves_to* : direction of travel of the molecule: equal to 1 if the upper leaflet is the new lealet, equal to -1 if the lower leaflet is the new leaflet
  
Flip-flop data area returned in a :class:`numpy.ndarray`, on a "one line, one observation" basis
and can be accessed via :attr:`FlipFlop.flip_flops`::

    flip_flops = [
        [
            <resindex (0-based)>,
            <end_frame (0-based)>,
            <start_frame (0-based)>,
            <moves_to>
        ],
        ...
    ]
    
*moves_to* is equal to 1 or -1 if the molecule flip-flops into the upper or the
lower leaflet, respectively.
    
Additionaly, the success or failure of each flip-flop event is stored in the
attribute :attr:`FlipFlop.flip_flop_success`.

Example usage of :class:`FlipFlop`
----------------------------------

An MDAnalysis Universe must first be created before using :class:`FlipFlop`::

  import MDAnalysis as mda
  from lipyphilic.lib.assign_leaflets import AssignLeaflets
  from lipyphilic.lib.flip_flop import FlipFlop

  u = mda.Universe(tpr, trajectory)

Then we need to know which leaflet each lipid is in at each frame. This may be done using
:class:`lipyphilic.lib.assign_leaflets.AssignLeaflets`::

  leaflets = AssignLeaflets(
    universe=u,
    lipid_sel="name GL1 GL2 ROH"  # assuming we are using the MARTINI forcefield
    midplane_sel="name ROH",       # only cholesterol is allowed to flip-flop
    midplane_cutoff=8.0,          # buffer size for assigning molecules to the midplane
  )
  leaflets.run()

The leaflet data are stored in the :attr:`leaflets.leaflets` attribute. We can now create our
:class:`FlipFlop` object::

  flip_flop = FlipFlop(
    universe=u,
    lipid_sel="name ROH",
    leaflets=leaflets.filter_leaflets("name ROH")  # pass only the relevant leaflet data
  )
  
We then select which frames of the trajectory to analyse (`None` will use every
frame)::
  
  flip_flop.run(
    start=None,
    stop=None,
    step=None
  )
  
The results are then available in the :attr:`flipflop.flip_flop` attribute as a
:class:`numpy.ndarray`. Each row corresponds to an individual flip-flop event, and
the four columns correspond, respectively, to the molecule resindex,
flip-flop start frame, flip-flop end frame, and the leaflet in which the molecule
resides after the flip-flop.

Specify minimum residence time for successful flip-flops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can also specify the minumum number of frames a molecule must reside in its new leaflet
for the flip-flop to be considered successful. We do this using the :attr:`frame_cutoff`
parameter::

  flip_flop = FlipFlop(
    universe=u,
    lipid_sel="name ROH",
    leaflets=leaflets.filter_leaflets("name ROH")
    frame_cuotff=10,
  )

With *frame_cutoff=10*, a molecule must remain in its new leaflet for at least 10
consecutive frames for the flip-flop to be considered successful. If this condition is not met,
the flip-flop event is recorded as failing.

Calculating the flip-flop rate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The flip-flop rate can be calculatd directly from the number of successfull flip-flop evetns,
which itself can be calculated as::

  n_successful = sum(flip_flop.flip_flop_success == "Success")
  
The rate is then given by the total number of successful flip-flops divided by the total
simulations time and the number of molecules of the translocating species.

        frame_cutoff : int, optional
            To be counted as a successful flip-flop, a molecule must reside in its new
