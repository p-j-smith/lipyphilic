======================================================

This module provides methods for determining registration of leaflets in a bilayer.

The degree of registration is calculated as the pearson correlation coefficient of
densities in the upper and lower leaflets. First, the 2D density of each leaflet,
:math:`L`, is calculated:

.. math::

  \rho(x, y)_{L} = \displaystyle \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp \Bigg({-}\frac{1}{2} \bigg(\frac{x' - x}{\sigma} \bigg)^2 \Bigg) \,dx' dy'


where the :math:`(x, y)` positions of lipid atoms in leaflet :math:`L` are binned
into two-dimensional histograms, then convolved with a circular Gaussian density
of standard deviation :math:`\sigma`. :math:`L` is either the upper (:math:`u`) or
lower (:math:`l`) leaflet.

The correlation between the two leaflets, :math:`r_{u/l}`, is then calculated as
the pearson correlation coefficient between :math:`\rho(x, y)_{u}` and
:math:`\rho(x, y)_{l}`, where values of:

* :math:`1` correspond to perfectly registered
* :math:`-1` correspond to perfectly anti-registered

For more information on interleaflet registration in bilayers
see `Thallmair et al. (2018) <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01877>`__.

Input
-----

Required:
  - *universe* : an MDAnalysis Universe object.
  - *upper_sel* : atom selection for lipids in the upper leaflet to use in the registration calculation
  - *lower_sel* : atom selection for lipids in the lower leaflet to use in the registration calculation
  - *leaflets* : leaflet membership (-1: lower leaflet, 0: midplane, 1: upper leaflet) of each lipid in the membrane.

Optional:
  - *filter_by* : boolean mask for determining which lipids to include in the registration calculation
  - *n_bins* : the number of bins to use in *x* and *y* for the 2D histogram
  - *gaussian_sd* : the standard deviation of the circular Gaussian to convole with the grid densities
  
Output
------

  - *registration* : the degree of interleaglet registration at each frame

The data are stored in the :attr:`registration.registration` attribute, containing the pearson
correlation coefficient of the two-dimensional leaflet densities at each frame.

Example usage of :class:`Registration`
--------------------------------------

An MDAnalysis Universe must first be created before using :class:`Registration`::

  import MDAnalysis as mda
  from lipyphilic.lib.registration import Registration

  u = mda.Universe(tpr, trajectory)


Then we need to know which leaflet each lipid is in at each frame. This may be done using
:class:`lipyphilic.lib.assign_leaflets.AssignLeaflets`::

  leaflets = AssignLeaflets(
    universe=u,
    lipid_sel="name GL1 GL2 ROH" # assuming we are using the MARTINI forcefield
  )
  leaflets.run()


The leaflets data are stored in the :attr:`leaflets.leaflets` attribute. We can now create our
Registration object by passing our :class:`lipyphilic.lib.assign_leaflets.AssignLeaflets`
object to :class:`Registration` along with atom selections for the lipids::

  registration = Registration(
    upper_sel="resname CHOL and name ROH",
    lower_sel="resname CHOL and name ROH",
    leaflets=leaflets.filter_leaflets("resname CHOL and name ROH")
  )
  
To calculate the interleaflet correlation of cholesterol molecules using their ROH
beads we then need to use the :func:`run()` method. We select which frames of the trajectory
to analyse (`None` will use every frame) and choose to display a progress bar (`verbose=True`)::
  
  registration.run(
    start=None,
    stop=None,
    step=None,
    verbose=True
  )

The results are then available in the :attr:`registration.registration` attribute as a
:class:`numpy.ndarray`. Again, :math:`1` corresponds to the leaflets being perfectly in register
and :math:`-1` corresponds to the leaflets being perfectly anti-registered.

Selecting a subset of lipids for the registration analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The previous example will compute the registration of cholesterol across the upper
and lower leaflets. In, for example, simulations of phase-separation domains, it is useful
to know the registration of liquid-ordered domains (regardless of the species in the domain)
rather than the registrtion of specific lipid species.

If we have a 2D array, 'lipid_order_data', that contains information on whether each lipid is in
the liquid-disordered phase or the liquid-ordered phase at each frame, we can used this to
calculate the registration of ordered domains. The array must take the shape
'(n_residues, n_frames)', and in the below example 'lipid_order_data[i, j]' would be equal to `-1`
if lipid 'i' is liquid-disordered at frame 'j' and equal to `1` if it is liquid-ordered::

  registration = Registration(
    upper_sel="name PO4 ROH",
    lower_sel="name PO4 ROH",
    leaflets=leaflets.leaflets,
    filter_by=lipid_order_data == 1
  )


If we have a ternary mixture of DPPC/DOPC/Cholesterol, we can also specifcy that we wish to
consider only DPPC and cholesterol in the liquid-ordered phase::

  registration = Registration(
    upper_sel="(resname CHOL and name ROH) or (resname DPPC and name PO4)",
    lower_sel="(resname CHOL and name ROH) or (resname DPPC and name PO4)",
    leaflets=leaflets.filter_leaflets("resname CHOL DPPC"),
    filter_by=lipid_order_data == 1
  )
  

Changing the resolution of the 2D grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the lipid positions of each leaflet are binned into a two-dimensional
histogram using :math:`n\_bins_x = \lceil{x}\rceil`, where :math:`n\_bins_x` is the
numer of bins in :math:`x` and :math:`\lceil{x}\rceil` is the size of system in :math:`x`
rounded up to the nearest integer. This gives a grid resolution of  *1* Å.

It is also possible to specify the number of bins to use for binning the data::

  registration = Registration(
    upper_sel="resname CHOL and name ROH",
    lower_sel="resname CHOL and name ROH",
    leaflets=leaflets.filter_leaflets("resname CHOL"),
    n_bins=100
  )


This will use *100* bins for creating the two-dimensional histogram. Fewer bins
will result in a performance increase but at the cost of spatial resolution. For
all but the largest systems, the default of *1* Å is appropriate. If your system
is larger than a few hundred nm in one dimension, you will likely want to set
:attr:`n_bins` to 2000 or less.

Changing the standard deviation of the circular Gaussian density
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The defualt value of :math:`\sigma` is *15*, which is the value used by
`Thallmair et al. (2018) <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01877>`__
for determining interleaflet cholesterol correlations. This deault value can be
changed using the :attr:`gaussian_sd` parameter::

  registration = Registration(
    upper_sel="resname CHOL and name ROH",
    lower_sel="resname CHOL and name ROH",
    leaflets=leaflets.filter_leaflets("resname CHOL"),
    gaussian_sd=12
  )


Figure 2d of `Thallmair et al. (2018)
<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01877>`__ shows how correlation
tends to increase with increasing :attr:`gaussian_sd`. This is because the density of
atomic positions is more diffuse and thus more likely to overlap between the two
leaflets. Increasing :attr:`gaussian_sd` also incurs a performance cost.
