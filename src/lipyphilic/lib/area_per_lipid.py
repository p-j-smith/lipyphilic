"""Area per lipid --- :mod:`lipyphilic.lib.area_per_lipid`
==========================================================

:Author: Paul Smith

This module provides methods for calculating the area per lipid in a bilayer.

The class :class:`lipyphilic.lib.area_per_lipid.AreaPerLipid` calculates the
area of each lipid via a 2D Voronoi tessellation of atomic positions. See
`Lukat et al. (2013) <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ci400172g>`_ for
a description of calculating the area per lipid via Voronoi tessellations.

This class uses `Freud <https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#>`_
for performing the Voronoi tessellations from which the area per lipid is
calculated.

Input
------

Required:
  - *universe* : an MDAnalysis Universe object.
  - *lipid_sel* : atom selection for lipids in the bilayer. These atoms will be used to perform the Voronoi tessellation.
  - *leaflets* : leaflet membership (-1: lower leaflet, 0: midplane, 1: upper leaflet) of each lipid in the membrane.
  

Output
------

  - *area* : area per lipid of each lipid as each frame
  
Area data are returned in a :class:`numpy.ndarray`, where each row corresponds
to an individual lipid and each columns corresponds to an individual frame. The
results are accessible via the :attr:`AssignLeaflets.leaflets` attribute.

Area data are returned in a :class:`numpy.ndarray`, where each row corresponds
to an individual lipid and each column corresponds to an individual frame, i.e.
*areas[i, j]* refers to the area of lipid *i* at frame *j*. The results are
accessible via the :attr:`AreaPerLipid.areas` attribute.

Note
----

No area can be calculated for molecules that are in the midplane,
i.e. those for which `leaflets==0`. These molecules will have `NaN` values
in the results array for the frames at which they are in the midplane.


Example usage of :class:`AreaPerLipid`
--------------------------------------

An MDAnalysis Universe must first be created before using AreaPerLipid::

  import MDAnalysis as mda
  from lipyphilic.lib.assign_leaflets import AssignLeaflets

  u = mda.Universe(tpr, trajectory)

Then we need to know which leaflet each lipid is in at each frame. This may be done using
:class:`lipyphilic.lib.assign_leaflets.AssignLeaflets`::

  leaflets = AssignLeaflets(
    universe=u,
    lipid_sel="name GL1 GL2 ROH" # assuming we are using the MARTINI forcefield
  )
  leaflets.run()

The leaflet data are stored in the :attr:`leaflets.leaflets` attribute. We can now create our
AreaPerLipid object::

  areas = AreaPerLipid(
    universe=u,
    lipid_sel="name GL1 GL2 ROH",
    leaflets=leaflets.leaflets
  )
  
The above will use GL1 and GL2 beads to calculate the area of each phospholipid, and the
ROH bead to calculate the area of each sterol. Two Voronoi tessellations will be performed at each
frame --- one for the upper leaflet and one for the lower leaflet.

We then select which frames of the trajectory to analyse (`None` will use every
frame) and choose to display a progress bar (`verbose=True`)::
  
  areas.run(
    start=None,
    stop=None,
    step=None,
    verbose=True
  )
  
Warning
-------
    
The frames used in calculating the area per lipid must be the same as those used for
assigning lipids to leaflets, i.e. the :attr:`start`, :attr:`stop` and :attr:`step` parameters must
be identical for :func:`AssignLeaflets.run()` and :func:`AreaPerLipid.run()`.


The results are then available in the :attr:`areas.areas` attribute as a
:class:`numpy.ndarray`. Each row corresponds to an individual lipid and each column
to an individual frame, i.e `areas.areas[i, j]` contains the area of lipid *i*
at frame *j*.

        lipid_sel : str
            Selection string for lipids in the bilayer. Typically, in all-atom
            simulations, one atom per sterol and three atoms per non-sterol lipid
            would be used. In coarse-grained simulations, one bead per sterol and
            two beads per non-sterol lipid would typically be used.
        leaflets : numpy.ndarray (n_lipids,)
            An array of leaflet membership in which: -1 corresponds to the lower leaflet;
            1 corresponds to the upper leaflet; and 0 corresponds to the midplane.
            If the array is 1D and of shape (n_lipids), each lipid is taken to
            remain in the same leaflet over the trajectory. If the array is 2D and
            of shape (n_lipids, n_frames), the leaflet to which each lipid is
            assisgned at each frame will be taken into account when calculating
            the area per lipid.
