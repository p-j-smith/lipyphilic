"""Area per lipid --- :mod:`lipyphilic.lib.area_per_lipid`
==========================================================

:Author: Paul Smith
:Year: 2021
:Copyright: GNU Public License v2

This module provides methods for calculating the area per lipid in a bilayer.

The class :class:`lipyphilic.lib.area_per_lipid.AreaPerLipid` calculates the
area of each lipid via a 2D Voronoi tessellation of atomic positions. See
`Lukat et al. (2013) <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ci400172g>`_ for
a description of calculating the area per lipid via Voronoi tessellations.

This class uses `Freud <https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#>`_
for performing the Voronoi tessellations from which the area per lipid is
calculated.

Input
------

Required:
  - *universe* : an MDAnalysis Universe object.
  - *lipid_sel* : atom selection for lipids in the bilayer. These atoms will be used to perform the Voronoi tessellation.
  - *leaflets* : leaflet membership (-1: lower leaflet, 0: midplane, 1: upper leaflet) of each lipid in the membrane.
  

Output
------

  - *area* : area per lipid of each lipid as each frame
  

Area data are returned in a :class:`numpy.ndarray`, where each row corresponds
to an individual lipid and each column corresponds to an individual frame, i.e.
*areas[i, j]* refers to the area of lipid *i* at frame *j*. The results are
accessible via the :attr:`AreaPerLipid.areas` attribute.

Note
----

No area can be calculated for molecules that are in the midplane,
i.e. those for which `leaflets==0`. These molecules will have `NaN` values
in the results array for the frames at which they are in the midplane.


Example usage of :class:`AreaPerLipid`
--------------------------------------

An MDAnalysis Universe must first be created before using AreaPerLipid::

  import MDAnalysis as mda
  from lipyphilic.lib.assign_leaflets import AssignLeaflets

  u = mda.Universe(tpr, trajectory)

Then we need to know which leaflet each lipid is in at each frame. This may be done using
:class:`lipyphilic.lib.assign_leaflets.AssignLeaflets`::

  leaflets = AssignLeaflets(
    universe=u,
    lipid_sel="name GL1 GL2 ROH" # assuming we are using the MARTINI forcefield
  )
  leaflets.run()

The leaflet data are stored in the :attr:`leaflets.leaflets` attribute. We can now create our
AreaPerLipid object::

  areas = AreaPerLipid(
    universe=u,
    lipid_sel="name GL1 GL2 ROH",
    leaflets=leaflets.leaflets
  )
  
The above will use GL1 and GL2 beads to calculate the area of each phospholipid, and the
ROH bead to calculate the area of each sterol. Two Voronoi tessellations will be performed at each
frame --- one for the upper leaflet and one for the lower leaflet.

We then select which frames of the trajectory to analyse (`None` will use every
frame) and choose to display a progress bar (`verbose=True`)::
  
  areas.run(
    start=None,
    stop=None,
    step=None,
    verbose=True
  )

The results are then available in the :attr:`areas.areas` attribute as a
:class:`numpy.ndarray`. Each row corresponds to an individual lipid and each column
to an individual frame, i.e `areas.areas[i, j]` contains the area of lipid *i*
at frame *j*.

Warning
-------
If your membrane is highly curved the calculated area per lipid will be inaccurate.
In this case we recommend you use either `FATSlim <https://pythonhosted.org/fatslim/>`__,
`MemSurfer <https://github.com/LLNL/MemSurfer>`__ or
`ML-LPA <https://vivien-walter.github.io/mllpa/>`__.

            simulations, one atom per sterol and three atoms per non-sterol lipid
            would be used. In coarse-grained simulations, one bead per sterol and
            two beads per non-sterol lipid would typically be used.
        leaflets : numpy.ndarray (n_lipids,)
            An array of leaflet membership in which: -1 corresponds to the lower leaflet;
            1 corresponds to the upper leaflet; and 0 corresponds to the midplane.
            If the array is 1D and of shape (n_lipids), each lipid is taken to
            remain in the same leaflet over the trajectory. If the array is 2D and
            of shape (n_lipids, n_frames), the leaflet to which each lipid is
            assisgned at each frame will be taken into account when calculating
            the area per lipid.

            determine its center of mass.
        start: int, optional
            Start frame for averaging the area per lipid results.
        stop: int, optional
            Final frame for averaging the area per lipid results.

            Number of frames to skip
        filter_by: array-like, optional
            A Boolean mask for selecting a subset of lipids.
            It may take the following shapes:
            
            ``(n_lipids)``
            The mask is used to select a subset of lipids for projecting the areas

            ``(n_lipids, n_frames)``

            The bin specification:
            
            ``int``
              If int, the number of bins for the two dimensions (nx=ny=bins).
              
            ``array-like``
              If array_like, the bin edges for the two dimensions (x_edges=y_edges=bins).
              
            ``[int, int]``
              If [int, int], the number of bins in each dimension (nx, ny = bins).
              
            ``[array, array]``
              If [array, array], the bin edges in each dimension (x_edges, y_edges = bins).
              
            ``combination``
              A combination [int, array] or [array, int], where int is the number of bins and array is the bin edges.
              
              The default is `None`, in which case a grid with 1 x 1 Angstrom resolution is created.
        
        ax: Axes, optional
            Matplotlib Axes on which to plot the projection. The default is `None`,
            in which case a new figure and axes will be created.

            The Colormap instance or registered colormap name used to map
            scalar data to colors.
        vmin, vmax : float, optional
            Define the data range that the colormap covers. By default,
            the colormap covers the complete value range of the supplied
            data.
        cbar : bool, optional
            Whether or not to add a colorbar to the plot.
        cbar_kws : dict, optional
            A dictionary of keyword options to pass to matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar.
        imshow_kws : dict, optional
